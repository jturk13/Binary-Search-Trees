I was tasked to write the following methods for a BinarySearchTree class: insert and find, both using iteration, insertRecursively and findRecursively, both using recursion, and traversal methods dfsPreOrder, dfsInOrder, dfsPostOrder, and bfs. Additionally, write a remove method to handle removing nodes with different child scenarios, an isBalanced method to check if the tree is balanced, and a findSecondHighest method to find the second highest value. Finally, implement an iterative version of dfsInOrder.
